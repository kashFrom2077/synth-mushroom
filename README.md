 Exploring Generative Models and Explainable AI for Mushroom Edibility Prediction

## Overview

This project explores the use of synthetic data generated by Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and Tabular Variational Autoencoders (TVAE) to enhance machine learning models for predicting mushroom edibility. Additionally, we apply explainable AI techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand the factors influencing model predictions.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

1. Synthetic Data Generation: Generate synthetic tabular datasets using CTGAN and TVAE to augment the training data.
2. Model Evaluation: Train and evaluate four classical machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Linear Discriminant Analysis) on the original and synthetic datasets.
3. Explainability: Use SHAP to interpret feature contributions to model predictions.

## Dataset

We utilized the Mushroom Edibility dataset introduced by Wagner et al. (2021), based on the widely-known UCI Mushroom Dataset (Schlimmer, 1987). The dataset consists of:

- Instances: 61,068
- Features: 22 categorical attributes
- Classes: Edible (e) and Poisonous (p)

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing categorical and numerical values using the mode and mean, respectively.
- Feature Engineering: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.
- Standardization: Scaled numerical features to ensure uniformity for training.

### Synthetic Data Generation

- CTGAN: Trained up to 600 epochs, balancing quality and computational efficiency.
- TVAE: Trained for 600 epochs, optimized for preserving feature correlations.

Code for synthetic data generation and preprocessing is available in `445SynthDataGen&PreProcess.ipynb`.

### Model Training

Four machine learning models were trained using both the original and synthetic datasets:

1. Random Forest
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes
4. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Code for training these models and applying explainable AI techniques is available in `classificationModels.ipynb`.

### Explainability

- SHAP was used to identify key features influencing predictions.

## Results

1. Synthetic Data Quality:

   - TVAE outperformed CTGAN in preserving feature correlations.
   - Both models maintained class distribution consistency with the original dataset.

2. Model Performance:

   - Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (100%) on the original dataset.
   - TVAE synthetic data provided better results compared to CTGAN, particularly for Logistic Regression and LDA.

3. Key Features:

   - Features like `stem-width`, `gill-attachment`, and `stem-color` were most influential in predicting edibility.

## Limitations

- Dataset was derived from textbook examples and may not fully represent real-world complexities.
- Lack of expert validation (e.g., mycologists) for the interpretability findings.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of synthetic data to enhance machine learning models for mushroom edibility classification. Explainable AI tools like SHAP provide valuable insights into model decision-making, increasing trust and transparency. Future work could focus on collecting real-world data and experimenting with advanced generative models.
